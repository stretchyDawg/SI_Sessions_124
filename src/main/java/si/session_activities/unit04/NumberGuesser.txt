NUMBER GUESSER GAME:
How to play:
- I pick a number from 0-100, you have to guess my number.
- You have 5 tries to get it. If you fail to do it in 5 tries, you lose.
(A bit different from the Number Guessing Tournament we did earlier, you don't get infinite tries and there are no hints).

HOW TO CODE NUMBER GUESSER GAME:
- Generate some random number (int) between 0-100.
- Create a TextField that enables a User to enter a guess.
- Create a "Guess" button & event handler that checks if the entered value is correct.
- Create a guess display Label that displays the amount of available guesses you have.
- Create an outcome Label that represents the outcome once you finish the game.
- If the amount of available guesses reaches zero, do not let the user enter submit a guess.
- If the User wins, display a cool winning sound!
