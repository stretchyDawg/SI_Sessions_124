GCIS-124 SI Mock Practicum
Time: 40 Minutes (you have 55 minutes (half the 110 minute period) to do your real practicum)

Welcome! You may do each problem in any order as you please. I would suggest you do the questions
that cover topics you are not familiar with FIRST. Get some practice with the hard stuff first. 

This session is a SAFE SPACE to get things wrong. When learning new concepts, since you are human 
you will definitely get things wrong. You might as well get it wrong at the SI Session instead of 
the real test. So give the frustrating questions a shot and ask your group table or me for help! 

Also I added points for you to grades yourselves!

Format:
1: Graphs and Search Algorithms (30 Points)
2: Inner Classes, Anon Classes, & Lambdas (30 Points)
3: Backtracking (35 Points)
4: Streams (5 Points)

—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Microsoft Flight Simulator (Algorithms -- 30 Points)


2: Discounts EVERYWHERE (Inner Classes, Anon Classes & Lambdas -- 30 Points)


3: Rat in a Maze (Backtracking -- 35 Points)


4: Creating Streams (Streams -- 5 Points)
Create a StreamMain.java class that only has a main method. Inside of that main method you will create a 
list of integers from 1-5. With that list, you must use streams to accomplish these three tasks:

- Print out every even number (for 1-5, you’d print out 2 and 4)
- Find the sum of every integer in the list (for 1-5 it’s 15)
- Return the number of integers greater than 3 (for 1-5 it’s 2)
