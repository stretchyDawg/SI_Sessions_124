GCIS-124 SI Mock Practicum
Time: 40 Minutes (you have way longer to do your real final practicum)

Welcome! You may do each problem in any order as you please. I would suggest you do the questions
that cover topics you are not familiar with FIRST. Get some practice with the hard stuff first. 

This session is a SAFE SPACE to get things wrong. When learning new concepts, since you are human 
you will definitely get things wrong. You might as well get it wrong at the SI Session instead of 
the real test. So give the frustrating questions a shot and ask your group table or us for help! 

Also I added points for you to grades yourselves!
