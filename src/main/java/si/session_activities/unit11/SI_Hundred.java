/**
 * 1 TO 100 UNLOCKED STYLE:
With your partner, create a HundredUnlocked.java file with just a main method:
- Step 1: Inside the class, create a static int field called currentNumber.
- Step 2: Additionally, you will also make a static final Object 
          field called lock, this is what you can use for your synchronized blocks.
- Step 3: Inside the main method, create two thread instances however you want.
- Step 4a: In one thread, print out all even numbers from 1-100, use the static field to do this.
- Step 4b: In the other, print out all odd numbers from 1-100, use the static field to do this.
- Step 5: Have it so that ALL of the time it prints out all the numbers in order (last time we 
          did this, it only did that SOME of the time). To do this, you will ONLY be using 
          synchronized blocks,  lock() and notify()/notifyAll().
